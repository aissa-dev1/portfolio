      "A dark fantasy tales web app, client-side only for now.",
      "Built with Next.js, TypeScript, SCSS modules. Backend is ready (NestJS), just not used yet.",
      "The theme is deep and old, like lost magic—animated pages, tale carousels, custom fonts, and a calm reading experience.",
      "Built it all solo: frontend, backend, design. Took 3 months of focus and experiments.",
      "It’s the place where I poured my imagination in—no rules, no limits. Learned a lot about server components, Suspense, and Error Boundaries."
